        <div class="sub_title">A drastic increase can be seen in food, clothes, and daily used things that are getting wasted.
            Out of which , food wastage plays a major role. Nearly 1/3rd of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally.
            Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or leftover and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
            Similarly, there are many other things like books which we donâ€™t use after studying , clothes which were not fitting us properly we will throw or we just leave them without knowing what to do with it.
            Instead of leaving these things unwantedly, it can be useful for the people who are really in the need of them.
